Learning blockchain by making one. This blockchain is designed to work in your browser, but use a meeting server to find other peers to communicate with. Once you know about peers, your client can send and receive coins in a secure, decentralized way.

#### Getting Started

To get started you'll need to install [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

Once you've installed all the dependencies you can start the app.

```
mix phx.server
```

Navigate to http://localhost:4000/ in your favorite browser.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`
