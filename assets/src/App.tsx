                A blockchain is a database. A place to store data you never want
                to change. For instance, Bitcoin is a blockchain of financial
                transactions. New blocks, are always added, never edited or
                deleted. And instead of one copy of the database, every
                participant has a copy.

                Every time a new block is created, it gets sent out to everyone
                else participating in the blockchain, and verified for accuracy.
                It is not possible to change history by editing a block's data,
                because you would have to change every copy of the blockchain at
                once (or at least 51%). How does the blockchain stay secure?

                The foundational technology of blockchain is hashing. A hash is
                a fixed length number that is uniquely generated no matter the
                input size.

                This is where data can be entered you want to store in the
                blockchain and securely distribute to the rest of your peers on
                the blockchain. Basically, anyone else on this website. Go ahead
                and input something you want to store.

                But you can't add a block with any hash to the blockchain. These
                blocks must have a hash that starts with 000. Finding a hash
                that starts with 000 is a complex mathematical task that acts as
                a "Proof of Work". An economic measure to deter denial of
                service attacks and other service abuses such as spam on a
                network by requiring some work from the service requester.
